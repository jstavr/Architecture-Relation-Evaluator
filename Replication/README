In the DataFileSystem Folder there exist several Folders: 
There must exist atleast the following:
	1 : ACDC_INPUT
	2 : Auxiliary_RSFS
	3 : CDIFS
	4 : CLUSTERED_SYSTEMS
	5 : File_RSFS
	6 : FILE_CLUSTERED_SYSTEMS
	7 : LIN_DEREK_GROUND_TRUTHS
	8 : RSFS

In order to obtain the same results that we provide in the Excels 
folder you will have to perform the following steps.

	1  : Execute the TextGTToIDGTTransformer.jar

this will find all filenames existing in both the GT provided by 
the original author and those which were actually found when the 
specific version was analysed. Then those filenames are substituted 
with their ID equivalent as is defined in our .rsf file as provided 
by the Fact Extraction ToolCHain (fetch tool).

	2  : Execute the FileRSFWriter.jar

this will perform a File Lift on the RSF translating all relations
to relations between files and modules and will write this in an
ACDC tool friendly format that is:
[RELATION] [ENTITYID_1] [ENTITYID_2]

	3  : Execute the ACDCExecutor.jar 

after the FileRSFWriter.jar has been run for all products available
the execution of ACDCExecutor.jar will perform clustering and the output id est the new clusters will be stored in the
CLUSTERED_SYSTEMS folder

	4  : Execute the ResultCalculator.jar

after providing the product name it will perform a set of 
techniques which will result in it printing out a few lines related 
to the execution and 3 matrices containing:

Tversky Coefficient between each cluster
File Containment as percentage of GT clusters
LOC Containment as percentage of GT clusters.

Product Names as Used in this Replicator:
Actual Name | Name used for files in DataFileSystem
Chromium   --> chromium
Hadoop 	   --> hadoop
Bash       --> bash
ITK        --> itk
ArchStudio --> astudio

Of cource if names are changed or you want to compare acdc results 
to another type of ground truth then you will have to provide a 
TXT format of the Ground Truth resembling the GT files in 
LIN_DEREK_GROUND_TRUTHS. Extract the RSF an CDIF of the project 
from the source code using fetch. and store the source code in the 
PRODUCT_SOURCE_CODE folder, all using the same name and appendix 
conventions.
